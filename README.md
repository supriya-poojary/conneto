## Team Workflow & Guidelines
1. **Never code directly on the `main` branch.**
2. Before starting a new task, always get the latest version of the project:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
3. Create a new branch for the task you are assigned (e.g., if you are building the homepage):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-homepage
   ```
4. Write your code, then save (commit) your work:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added initial homepage design"
   ```
5. Push your new branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-homepage
   ```
6. Go to GitHub, open a **Pull Request (PR)**, and assign the Team Lead for review.
